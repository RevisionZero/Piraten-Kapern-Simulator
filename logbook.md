  Is this MVP really viable?
  
  Can some features be simplified?
  
 -Answers:
 
   -Yes, there aren't that many features specified and the ones that are specified lack heavy detail
   
   -No, several key features and functions of the game are missing, such as rolling X number of dice(from 0-8)
   
   -No, the features/functions and their descriptions are already simple enough; further simplification would result in an incomplete product
