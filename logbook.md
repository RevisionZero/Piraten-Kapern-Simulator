-Read the game rule book

-Read the backlog description in README.md


-Questions:

  Is this MVP really minimal?
  
  Is this MVP really viable?
  
  Can some features be simplified?
  
 -Answers:
 
   -Yes, in the sense that it tries to describe only the essential features and not any fancy additions
   
   -No, this description takes away the player's ability to decide which dice to keep, which is one of the most important aspects of the game, and it takes away the player's ability to decide whether to re-roll or not, which is another critical feature. Additionally, there are other important missing features, such as cards. In short, this description is an automated re-rolling of the dice until the player is out.
   
   -No, the features/functions and their descriptions are already simple enough; further simplification would result in even the most basic of features not resembling how they work in the real world
